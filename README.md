# FinalProject2022
This repository goes through my Final Year Project completed during my final year in the National College of Ireland. The project topic was "An analysis of the casuese and prevention of diabetes". This paper composes of; statistical anlaysis of data used during the project, machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence primarily using Neural Networks. This paper will provide the coding scripts and screenshots to understand the background of the project. 
# Project Aims:
The aims of the project were to explore suitable model classifiers that would predict the best outcome of diabetes, use statistcial analysis to understand the background importance of features and what factors had the most effect on predicting diabetes.
