# FinalProject2022
This repository summarises the Final Year Project of my BSc at the National College of Ireland. The project topic was "An analysis of the causes and prevention of diabetes". This repository contains; statistical anlaysis of data used during the project, machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence / Neural Network models used for the analysis of clinical and lifestyle data related to diabetes. The repository also contains the coding scripts and screenshots to help understand the background to the project. 
# Project Aims:
The aims of the project were to explore the performance of model classifiers to help predict the likliehood of diabetes given certain data, using statistcial analysis to understand the background importance of features and models to understand that factors had the most effect on predicting diabetes.
