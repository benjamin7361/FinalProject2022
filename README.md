# FinalProject2022
This repository summarises the Final Year Project of my BSc at the National College of Ireland. The project topic was "An analysis of the causes and prevention of diabetes". This repository contains; statistical anlaysis of data used during the project, machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence / Neural Network models used for the analysis of clinical and lifestyle data related to diabetes. The repository also contains the coding scripts and screenshots to help understand the background to the project. 
# Project Aims:
The aims of the project were to explore the performance of model classifiers to help predict the likliehood of diabetes given certain data, using statistcial analysis to understand the background importance of features and models to understand that factors had the most effect on predicting diabetes. 
# Datasets:
I had collected two different datasets from Kaggle an online machine learning community and data repository. One was collected from a BRFSS study which involved colleting information over the phone. The other was patient data extracted from > 130 US hospitals. 
# RStudio:
During the projects Data Modelling phase i had carried out three different classification classifiers in RStudio. From using the follwing classifiers; Decision Trees, Random Forest and Naive Bayes I had collected a total of 12 different results.
